Amazingly, he is a gifted alchemist; not only can he perform alchemy, but, like Ed, he doesn't need a transmutation circle. He also has other amazing abilities, compelling Izumi to take the child in. Ed, however, is suspicious of the boy's sudden appearance, and doesn't believe he is as innocent as he appears to be.",
