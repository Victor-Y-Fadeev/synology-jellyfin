This distracts the attention of the Fuhrer and his minions, while the real Mustang plots his attack on the Fuhrer in Central. Al has been abducted by Envy. Sensei and Ed are forced to pursue the only lead they have on the Homunculi, the Fuhrer himself. They assault the headquarters to find the Fuhrer has gone home early, but they are fortunate in their timing, and are able to help the Tringham brothers (imposter Elrics) escape from prison there. Ed goes off to fight the Fuhrer while sensei battles with the new and improved Frank Archer.",
