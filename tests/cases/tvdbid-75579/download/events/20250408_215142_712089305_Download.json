The Fuhrer, in turn, places orders for the brothers to be captured. Mustang takes this responsibility, knowing that if they are captured by anyone else, they would surely not get the opportunity to explain themselves. Winry and Seska have gone to Rizenbul to lay low for a while after their scare at the military base. To their surprise, the mysterious stranger on the train turned out to be none other than Hoenheim, the Elric's father. They receive word of the hunt of Ed and Al, and the two go to try to help. Ed and Al, for unclear reasons, are hurrying back to their hometown, knowing that the military would surely be there, but they are not dissuaded, and trouble brews as Mustang's soldiers get closer and closer.",
