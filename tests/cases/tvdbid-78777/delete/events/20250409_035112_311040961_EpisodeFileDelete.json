Wagnard has been filled with Kardis' immense power, and he takes it out on Ashram, striking with dark magic that slams Ashram into walls and to the brink of death. But Ashram is not about to lose, and when Parn arrives at the scene, a battle ensues among the three. Wagnard seems to have the upper hand, but the battle turns to the two heroes with the swords that were once held by Beld and Fahn, with the future of Lodoss hanging on the edge.",
