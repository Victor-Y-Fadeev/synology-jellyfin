The Marmo surround the Valis forces, and the battle wears down both sides. Parn briefly encounters Ashram and they engage in combat for the first time. But that fight and others are deferred as King Fahn calls out Emperor Beld in a single one-on-one fight to the death. Parn tries to help Fahn but learns of Karla's motivation for the war and the secret key to her power.",
