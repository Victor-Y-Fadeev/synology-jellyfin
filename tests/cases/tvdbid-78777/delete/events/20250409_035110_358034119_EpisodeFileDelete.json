This involves a really long platform descent into the depths of the earth. The armies of Lodoss approach Marmo, with Parn already ahead to storm the castle ruins. As he plunges deeper into the network, his friends stop off to hold back various monsters, and soon Parn is left alone to forge ahead. Outside, Narse and the evil dragons threaten to annihilate Kashue and Jester's forces until Mycen the Golden Dragon gets involved. Meanwhile Ashram makes his way to face Wagnard and have his revenge.",
