The six main heroes are already on a quest, and the action-driven episode introduces the characters and their dilemmas in quick succession. Young Parn yearns to be a true knight. Etoh's a novice priest of Falis. Wizard Slayn and dwarf Ghim are old friends. Deedlit is a beautiful elf, and Woodchuck is a thief. An encounter with a dragon and the Grey Witch Karla set up some initial threads for the tale to follow.|Ghim begins his quest to find Leylia, the daughter of the priestess Neese. A band of goblins go after a young woman named Liara but she is saved by Parn, a villager and a teenage son of a former knight. But Parn has killed off one of the goblins, who the villagers normally leave alone, and now the goblins want revenge. As Ghim meets up with Slayn the sorcerer, Etoh the cleric helps Parn track down the goblin lair, but they learn soon enough that the goblins are raiding the village!|Beld, the Emperor of Marmo, an island south of Lodoss begins his plan to conquer Lodoss. He leads two subjects, Ashram the Black Knight, and Wagnard the Dark Sorceror. Karla also appears to be in cahoots with them.\r",
