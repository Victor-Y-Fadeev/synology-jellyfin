One is the newly healed and stronger Bando. The other is a diclonius just like Lucy. At Kouta’s house, Yuka and a homeless girl named Mayu talk about the events that happened two nights ago at the beach. All of a sudden, Nyuu slips and falls. She bangs her head and Lucy awakens inside of her. Will Kouta and the others be safe with the murderous Lucy in their house? And will Lucy stand a chance against a fellow diclonius?",
