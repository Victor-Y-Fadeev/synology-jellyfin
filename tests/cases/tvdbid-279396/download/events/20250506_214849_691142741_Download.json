They knock Ryōta out - not wanting him to risk his life any longer. Chisato remarks how Takachiho's aim is to use \"Ain Soph Aur\" to reset the Earth in a whole new era. Though his only intention is to revive Rena, Kotori responds Chisato how she wants others to smile regardless of her life, so she ejects her own harness therefore cancels the light phenomenon. Mako slices Kazumi, but spares Neko as her little sister. As Nanami guides Ryōta, he finds Kotori's melting body. Listening to her final words, she asks Ryōta to tell her big brother not to harm anyone, and that she was happy till the very end. He also hears over Kazumi, as she mutters of wishing to have kids with Ryōta. Mako recalls how Chisato saved her once when exposing himself to radiation. Chisato commands to have Neko ejected until Ryōta hits him aside, shouting out Kotori/Rena's words at him.",
