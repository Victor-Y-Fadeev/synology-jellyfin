Exposing her chest, Ryōta discovers the mole|Meeting Mako and Chisato who have arrived at the observatory are demanding to hand over #1107 who's in fact—Kotori. Ryōta distracts them for Hatsuna to jump on Mako from behind, but can't figure out which button to push on Mako's harness having her to slice Hatsuna. Wanting an explanation why they have to be killed, Chisato states the B-rank witches are unreasonable to live. He orders Mako to kill Neko, but Ryōta push her away and takes the hit from Mako's magic. Losing consciousness, Nanami appears in astral form to Ryōta informing that Neko used to be an S-rank witch stronger than Mako, the way to regain her power is by pressing the top button of her harness but it's a high risk; then Ryōta dies. With the girls distressed and defenseless, Mako about to finish them off, but then a group of black individuals arrive who have neutralized Mako's magic. Following the device's signal that Ryōta turned on earlier. Yet, Chisato escapes using Mako's teleportation taking Kotori along. Hatsuna had recovered and using her ability to heal; with Neko and Kazumi giving heart aid, they revive Ryōta. Hatsuna melts in the process however. Miki and the individuals introduce themselves as Hexenjagd, a group resisting the lab, stating the witches still has to die because the amoebas \"drasils\" inside them - the witches' true form - will eventually hatch and devour their bodies into monsters. Moreover, Kotori has an entity called the \"Grane\" that can destroy all humanity. They tried to capture Kotori once, but failed, causing the witches' escape and losing a comrade (Akane). Kotori awakens before Chisato, calling her Rena. Rena was Chisato's younger sister whom believed was the only life meaningful to him until she died of sickness. He tells Kotori how aliens were believed to be the creation of humans on Earth. His efforts to revive Rena's soul within Kotori's body somehow. Not giving up, despite the revelation, Kazumi hacks in the lab's database locating Chisato's whereabouts ne|The light covers the Earth with Hexenjagd left praying for God, so Ryōta, Neko, and Kazumi go to rescue Kotori on their own. They knock Ryōta out - not wanting him to risk his life any longer. Chisato remarks how Takachiho's aim is to use \"Ain Soph Aur\" to reset the Earth in a whole new era. Though his only intention is to revive Rena, Kotori responds Chisato how she wants others to smile regardless of her life, so she ejects her own harness therefore cancels the light phenomenon. Mako slices Kazumi, but spares Neko as her little sister. As Nanami guides Ryōta, he finds Kotori's melting body. Listening to her final words, she asks Ryōta to tell her big brother not to harm anyone, and that she was happy till the very end. He also hears over Kazumi, as she mutters of wishing to have kids with Ryōta. Mako recalls how Chisato saved her once when exposing himself to radiation. Chisato commands to have Neko ejected until Ryōta hits him aside, shouting out Kotori/Rena's words at him.",
