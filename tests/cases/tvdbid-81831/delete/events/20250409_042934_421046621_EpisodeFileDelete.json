She attempts many times throughout the episode to obtain Rito's attention, such as she tries to lure him towards her with a fishing pole, sneaking up behind him as he's bringing back ice cream, using a vacuum to pull him away from a waterslide, and even by using fiber eating fish to eat away each of the girls bikini tops in order to scare them away from rito. All attempts fail however, sending Run into a state of depression. She encounters Montemitsu who then buys her food. Run then enounters rito's teacher, who she then requests from him to teach her the ways of becoming famous, for Run now decides she wants to become a famous idol. After rigorous training, Run decides it's too hard of a feat to accomplish. She then gets attacked by some people, which then Rito shows up to save her. Lala defeats the attackers using one of her inventions. The episode closes as everyone leaves the water park, and Run states that her fight for love has only begun.",
