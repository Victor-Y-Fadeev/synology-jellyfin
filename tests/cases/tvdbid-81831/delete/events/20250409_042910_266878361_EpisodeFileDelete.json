That night, Lala cooks but the food is dreadful. In an effort to try and get out of one day participating in wars, Rito shouts that if he will not marry Lala if she cannot cook. Lala quickly leaves and goes back into space, but appears again the next day at school with the intention of cooking something good for Rito. She collected ingredients from all over the galaxy which are still alive and reek havoc in the school. Lala later explains to Rito that he does not have to go to war if he does not want to, and even her father did not join in on the battlefield lately. To further reassure him, Lala tells him that after they get married, she intends to live with him on Earth.",
