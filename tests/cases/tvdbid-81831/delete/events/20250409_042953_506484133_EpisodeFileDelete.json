With more challenges, he starts to lose hope and eventually goes into a dream of him, Haruna, and Lala. After awakening to Haruna and Lala yelling, he makes it to the ship. Then it cuts to a marriage where Lala says she can't marry him unless he wants to. Using her memory erasing tool, she then tries to start a new life on Earth, but ends up just transferring back into the school because her invention, like many others, is faulty, and a new adventure then begins.",
