She gets really angry by this and tells her friends to give Lala a letter asking to challenge her in a beauty contest. To make sure she shows up, she kidnaps Rito as bait. Lala ends up telling Zastin about the letter, which he mistakes as an assassination attempt from Saki. Rito, still kidnapped by her, is warned by her that if Lala fails to show up in time, he will be forced to touch her breasts in front of the entire school.",
