  "sonarr_episodefile_episodeoverviews": "A haunted school building is shown at the episode's beginning. Lala, Risa, Mio, and a frightened Haruna are seen conversing about ghosts and monsters. Lala then suggests that the four of them and Rito should go explore the haunted house. As they all enter the buildling, a lock closes behind them by itself. They continue to explore the old school and hear what sounds like approaching footsteps. Rito notices Haruna's fright, and tries to leap at the approaching figure, only to find out it's Yami-chan. They then hear a piano which chases after them. Yami slices the piano into pieces and everything seems alright. But a skeleton and a disfigured looking human then appear, constantly saying \"get out\". An octopus creature appears, which frightens Haruna to such an extent that she uses Rito as a weapon and deals a mighty blow to the creature's head. The other monsters then show themselves to the group, but this time with no hostility. They explain to the group that they are aliens from other down-sized planets that have gathered in the old building. Mikado-sensei appears and tries to help the monsters find a job in order to make a living for themselves. Also, a ghost girl named Oshizu appears and explains everything about herself to the group. Mikado and the monsters appear again to tell he group that the person they talkto for hiring only wants female monsters, which none of the monsters are. Oshizu then teaches them how to be more feminine, and the monsters are then accepted for their jobs. Lala, Rito, Yami-chan, and Mikado are then invited to a party where all the monsters are. The episode closes as Lala and Rito are astonished to see Zastin attending the party.",
