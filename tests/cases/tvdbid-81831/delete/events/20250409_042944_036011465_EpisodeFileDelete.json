After Lala calls upon Zastin and her other bodyguards to help rebuild the dilapidated building, the Yuuki Pavilion opens and begins accepting customers. While the number of customers increases, Rito finds himself overrun and is quickly becoming exhausted; as a result he begins to recruit help from Oshizu, the ghost inhabiting the building, Yami-chan, who works as a maid in order to stay for free, and his sister Mikan who will be the chef for the inn. As the number of customers eventually dwindles to zero, a large group of miniature samurai-like men, from the planet Ako, begin to arrive. During repeated attempts to solidify an attack plan on the planet Deviluke, they are repeatedly interrupted by Rito's attempts to offer them food and a bath. Eventually the leader accepts an offer of tea while he is in the midst of using a hologram to show the systems outlying Deviluke. When one of his men tries to hide the hologram, he responds by saying, \"Don't mind it. The primitive people of Earth won't understand what it is.\" Lala, however, immediately recognizes the planet on display which leads to a confrontation between the samurai and Rito, Lala, Yumi-chan, Zastin and the bodyguards. In the end, the inn is destroyed and with it Rito's dreams of being the universe's best alien hotel are lost.",
