Rito hypothetically asks him if it were somehow possible to back out of his engagement and not suffer the repercussions. Zastin tells him that he must feel up Lala's breasts once more within the first three days of his engagement in order to call it off. While he attempts many times to touch Lala's breasts, he does not make it in time, and thus is stuck with the engagement. The next day while at school, a new transfer student is announced to the class. Just as Rito is thinking that school is the only place that he can breathe anymore, Lala is brought into class and all of Rito's hopes of a quiet school life fall apart.",
