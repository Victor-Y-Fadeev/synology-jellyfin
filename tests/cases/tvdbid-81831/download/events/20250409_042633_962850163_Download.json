Not only does she try to clean it up, but enforce some new school rules, and has a squad so to speak, to check on the students. Shortly later, Yui has started to realize that Rito is behind all the \"ecchi\" in school. So she gives him punishment so he wont be able to talk to any girls for 2 weeks (well after persuading the peverted principal of course). But Yui comes to see that Rito isnÂ´t like that, and then removes his punishment. Yet things go badly wrong when Lala's machine pulls him to her.",
