He starts training and meets Haruna, walking her dog, Maron, during his first run. After explaining to Haruna that he must change, she decides to cheer him on, meeting everyday during his runs. His goal to change also affects Haruna, who eventually asks him on date to eat lunch together at the river bank. During that time, Haruna's dog chased a bird and eventually lands into the river. After Rito saves him, the two go to Haruna's house to clean Rito's wet clothes. While waiting for his clothes to dry (Rito ended up wearing a towel), the two talked about their middle school days. When Haruna was about to go to check if Rito's clothes were dry, she trips. They almost kiss, only to have Haruna's older sister walk in on them, and it turns into another awkward situation when Rito's towel falls off.",
