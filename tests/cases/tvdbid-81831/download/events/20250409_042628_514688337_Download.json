There, he uses tentacles to feel her and lure Rito to the room. When he gets there, the alien tells him that he will give him Haruna if Rito cancels his engagement with Lala, but Rito does not go along with his plan. After Lala arrives, the alien shape-shifts again and becomes much large and intimidating, but Rito stands his ground and attacks the alien head-on which makes him reveal himself as a weakling who has many wives and families across the galaxy.",
