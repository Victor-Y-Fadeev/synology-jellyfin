At home, his younger sister Mikan notices Rito's depressed look and suggests that they should go out the next day to show Lala around town. While out, Lala's artificial intelligence helper Peke loses most of his energy, and due to this, Lala's clothes start dissolving. They head into a store and buy her new clothes, and while there run into Haruna. Together with Haruna, they go to the aquarium together, but their time is cut short when Lala makes a large disturbance which sends torrents of water throughout the halls.",
