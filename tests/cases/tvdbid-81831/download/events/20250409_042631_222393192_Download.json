He constantly attempts to impress Lala by showing off his strength, speed, and looks, but all his efforts are in vain. After failing many times, Ren asks Rito how he is able to be manly enough for Lala. Ren watches a movie (Rocky VII) about how to be a man, and he works out non-stop in order to get Lala to love him. Eventually, Ren completes runs a 120 kilometer marathon and goes to Lala to hear her finally tell him how manly he is. However, at this time, he sneezes, causing him to turn into Run, a girl. Apparently, whenever Ren sneezes, his body and mind change genders into the innocent Run, and vice versa, due to his species carrying this inherent ability.",
