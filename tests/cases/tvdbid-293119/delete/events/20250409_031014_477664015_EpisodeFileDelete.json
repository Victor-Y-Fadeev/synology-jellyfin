Centorea explains that slimes are one of many species as yet unrecognized by human society; the slime then attacks again, and when Centorea's sword has no effect, both her and Kimihito end up covered in slime. When he goes to take a bath, she joins him after being unable to get clean. She conjectures that the slime was attacking them to get water; it then attacks them again in the bath. When Centorea falls and is knocked unconscious, the slime takes the form of a woman and begins imitating his washing of Cerea; due to her body being liquid, however, she almost drowns him before he escapes by diluting her in the tub. They debate what to do with her, and Papi reveals that she has named her Suu. The girls point out that she is likely an illegal immigrant; Papi overhears this and flees with Suu, thinking they mean to turn her in. When Kimihito catches up with them, they are apprehended by a group of children who often play with Papi. When one of the children is almost hit by a truck driven by the racist couple from the first episode, Suu saves her but falls off a bridge. Luckily, Kimihito gets under her with the crashed truck before she falls in the water. After that, he decides to let her stay at his house. They go home, only to find Smith there.",
