With various mishaps, the three work together to save a girl who was stuck in a tree. When a policeman arrives, Kimihito claims to be Papi's host family to keep her from being deported. The officer is skeptical, but Smith arrives with Papi's papers just in time, and tells Kimihito that she was on her way to make the harpy live with him. While out grocery shopping, Kimihito collides with Centorea. She becomes convinced that Kimihito is her soulmate. Encountering a purse-snatcher, the two pursue him. They eventually catch him, despite various embarrassing accidents. When the thief tries to attack Centorea with her dropped sword, Kimihito leaps in front of her and takes the blow, but survives due to the sword being a fake. Later, Smith explains that Kimihito riding Centorea could be viewed as akin to rape, since only a centaur's chosen master may ride them. Centorea chooses him as her master, resulting in her joining his household.",
