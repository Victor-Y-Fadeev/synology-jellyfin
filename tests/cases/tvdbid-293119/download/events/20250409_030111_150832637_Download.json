They are soon followed and interrupted by Miia and Papi, and the three begin fighting for Kimihito's affection. Smith arrives with a tranquilizer gun to stop them, but accidentally shoots Kimihito instead. When he wakes up at home, the three are apologetic for the harm they have caused him, but he dismisses their worries. Smith then announces that there has been a change to the Interspecies Exchange Bill, and she wants him to marry one of the girls as a test case. That night, Miia arrives in his room and tries to seduce him, only to be interrupted by Papi, who crashes through the window. Centorea arrives and explains that the full moon is to blame their abnormal behavior; however, it soon becomes clear that she is also affected.",
