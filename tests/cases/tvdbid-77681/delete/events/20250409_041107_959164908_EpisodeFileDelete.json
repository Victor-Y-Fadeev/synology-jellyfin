Lina and the gang try all their standard spells but with no luck. Pokota even tries the sword of light, but it runs out. Lina and the gang retreat and rest up. Wizer reports the next morning that the city of Brokol has been leveled, and Zanaffar is growing stronger. Meanwhile, Duclis makes a deal with Zanaffar. Pokota feels he needs to take sole responsibility, and tries to leave the party, but Lina and the gang decline; they will help him instead.",
