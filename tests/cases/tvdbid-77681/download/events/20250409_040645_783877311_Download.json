The battles are fierce, especially when Gourry only has a stone sword. Lina tries a few trick spells against Yuuma but he quickly catches on and dodges them. Duclis and Pokota talk about the day when Taforashia was afflicted with the disease, and what Rezo did to save their people, including putting them in their current forms. Zuuma uses the dark mist to cancel out magic attacks. Lina launches all sorts of spells, but when things look bleak, Pokota manages to turn the tide, when he and a supposedly sympathetic Duclis arrive. But as some enemies fall, a new enemy is about to rise.",
