  "sonarr_episodefile_episodeoverviews": "Lina and Gourry bump into some pirates on the high seas, and demonstrate they still got what it takes to beat up the bad guys. The pirates have a fish woman who was taken hostage. Zelgadis travels with Amelia, who brings her Seyruun fleet to Lina. As the gang reunite, a guy named Wizer Flayon, an inspector from the kingdom of Ruvignald, proceeds to arrest Lina Inverse with the crime of being Lina Inverse. As the gang try to bail out of town, they encounter increasing military opposition and someone who can cast a Dragon Slave!|Amelia and Zelgadis explain why they brought Wizer to Lina. Wizer is still intent on arresting Lina, but Lina presses him to provide reasons for suspecting her. Wizer talks about how some mage tanks have been destroyed recently, but the evidence is still circumstantial. Wizer arranges for them to guard a mage tank at a fortress. But the little green creature who casted the Dragon Slave in the last episode causes some more shenanigans. While Amelia and Zelgadis tend to the wounded, Lina and Gourry manage to chase down the creature, who goes by the name of Pokota.|In the middle of an eating challenge between Gourry and Lina, Wiser arrests Lina for abducting pets of nearby rich nobles. Lina protests as usual, but in addition to proving her innocence, she hears that the nobles are offering a reward for their pets return. Lina and the gang attempt to cross a lake to a mysterious and dangerous island.|Lina tries to hunt down Pokota in the woods and nearly destroys all the woodland creatures. Later she and Gourry go into town. Zelgadis comes up with a plan to capture Pokota by luring him with food, and it actually works! Pokota reveals that he is trying to stop the mage tanks from destroying everything, and suddenly Amelia is sympathetic to his cause and sides with him. They go into town where they encounter one of the magic tanks shaped like a rabbit, but little do they know it's actually a fake tank created by Lina and Gourry.|Lina and the gang follow Pokota into a forest that suddenly grows misty. They end up encountering Xellos, who is wandering in the woods. The mist reveals a lost city of Tarofshia whose inhabitants were put into suspended animation by Rezo the Red Priest (yes, that Rezo) in order to save them from a disease that was incurable back then. But strange things are amiss as Pokota discovers that someone's invaded the king's mansion.|Lina and the gang are hired to create a golem and compete in a ball rolling contest with a large amount of food and money (just the right incentive for Lina) as a reward. But her rivals are not pushovers as they include Pokota and a duo sent by Duclis to go after the Sword of Light.|On the way to Ruvinagald, the gang boards a ship and live it up with food and relaxation all thanks to poor Amelia. But instead of dealing with pirates, they get attacked by monsters and flying arrows. Lina and Pokota stage an act where they try to draw out their assassins, but are surprised at the result. Later on the assassin of assassins Zuuma makes his debut and that means big trouble for Lina.|Lina's party reaches the outskirts of Ruvinagald but Wizer is there to arrest her, and has taken the time to build an elaborate building full of traps and tricks. That should be a cinch for Lina, but thanks to Wizer's alliance with Xellos, the traps are especially devised to exploit Lina's weaknesses, such as her desire to push buttons that are marked \"do not push\". And when Xellos himself becomes one of the obstacles, Lina's group is in serious trouble.|Lina had surrendered to Wizer, and the group is brought to Marquess Giaconda's place, to be held in the dungeon. Wizer suggests they use Lina to fight the mage tanks to prove their power. Xellos decides that Wizer isn't aligned with his agenda and has him fall into a pit. Meanwhile, Pokota sneaks into the castle but encounters Duclis, and it is revealed they were former friends. Lina's group gets freed by Ozel, but they end up in an underground arena and now have to battle some fierce enemies.|Duclis and Pokota square off against each other, while Lina, Gourry, Amelia, and Zelgadis have to fight Marquess Gioconda, Ozel, and Yuuma. The battles are fierce, especially when Gourry only has a stone sword. Lina tries a few trick spells against Yuuma but he quickly catches on and dodges them. Duclis and Pokota talk about the day when Taforashia was afflicted with the disease, and what Rezo did to save their people, including putting them in their current forms. Zuuma uses the dark mist to cancel out magic attacks. Lina launches all sorts of spells, but when things look bleak, Pokota manages to turn the tide, when he and a supposedly sympathetic Duclis arrive. But as some enemies fall, a new enemy is about to rise.|Zanaffar has arisen from the ashes, absorbing the bearer of the true Zanaffar armor. He is hungry for power and destroys Gioconda's mansion easily. Lina and the gang try all their standard spells but with no luck. Pokota even tries the sword of light, but it runs out. Lina and the gang retreat and rest up. Wizer reports the next morning that the city of Brokol has been leveled, and Zanaffar is growing stronger. Meanwhile, Duclis makes a deal with Zanaffar. Pokota feels he needs to take sole responsibility, and tries to leave the party, but Lina and the gang decline; they will help him instead.|Lina's group rush to Seyruun where Zanaffar has targeted the gate to the kingdom. Sylphiel is there; she and troops try to defend but are not having much luck. Lina and the gang arrive and get in the way. With the sword of light in Pokota's hand, Duclis has Zanaffar retreat, but they will be back. As Lina and Gourry eat up to re-energize, Pokota asks Prince Phil to help out, but Phil's advisors are uncomfortable with the idea. Phil decides to assist Pokota and Lina's party heads out to confront Duclis and Zanaffar in a neighboring abandoned part of town.|Gourry manages to land a hit with the sword of light, but Zanaffar retreats into the ground. In an effort to create another Zanaffar, the mighty astral demon dragon strikes down Duclis. Pokota rushes to try to help his former comrade. Meanwhile Lina's group reassembles at the gates of Seyruun for one last stand against Zanaffar.",
